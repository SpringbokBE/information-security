## About
This project is situated in the domain of error-correcting coding for Audio CDs. The first part of the project comprises the implementation of a Reed-Solomon encoder/decoder. In the second half of the project a part of the audio CD system, as described in its original standard, is implemented. This is all done in Matlab.

## Part 1 : Reed-Solomon coding

File: `RSCode.m`

## Part 2 : Cross-Interleaved Reed-Solomon coding

File: `AudioCD.m`

## Requirements

The application is tested on Windows 10 using:

* `Matlab 9.7`

## Installation

Run any of the `.m` files. Static methods are provided to do some basic testing.

## Folder structure

```
